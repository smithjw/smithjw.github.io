These headphones are amazing, I had the chance to head into Store DJ today and have a listen and the sound was pristine, brilliant highs and heart pumping lows. The isolation is another key point, you can barely hear youself talk when wearing these. The construction is sturdy and they are as light as the Sony MDR-V6's that I currently own (a big selling point).  The $400+ price tag is worth it and I can't wait to buy these.Amazing
