title: Snow Leopard Installed!!!
type: post
---
So just finished installing Snow Leopard onto my 17" MacBook Pro (Late 2008), all went well and only took about half an hour, even though it said it would take 1 hour.  I even got back more than the 7GB of space which was a bonus :D.  I've added some photos, and everything seems a lot more snappier, yay.

Sorry for the crappy quality, they were taken on my 3G iPhone, and we all know that camera sucks just a tiny bit.
