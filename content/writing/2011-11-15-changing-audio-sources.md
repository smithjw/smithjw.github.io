If you're wanting to record audio on your Mac be it in a video or just straight audio and are trying to figure out why the quality may still be lacking after plugging in an external microphone, take a quick detour into your System Preferences and click onto the Sound Preference Pane. Then click on Input and select the source that you want to record from, in my case a Samson C01U USB microphone. Here you can also adjust the audio levels and make sure that everything is working.
