title: Programming YubiKeys in a VM
type: post
---

I've finally had some time to play with the [YubiKey 4C][1] and decided I wanted to get it functioning as a second factor with [Okta][2]. [This guide][3] from Yubico seemed fairly straight-forward but I immediately ran into an issue. While the [YubiKey Personalization Tool][4] (what you use to program the YubiKey) would recognise my YubiKey, it would show that there was an unknown error.

I did a bit of hunting online and didn't find much so reached out to Yubico's support. To their credit I got a reply within an hour with a solution to the problem. It turns out the Personalization Tool is incompatible with [Karabiner-Elements][5] (a popular key remapper for macOS - they must get this a lot as I did indeed have it installed).

Not wanting to remove Karabiner from my system, I decided I'd try to get the YubiKey app installed in a macOS VM. This also seems to be a better idea as the guide above says you should create your YubiKey configuration on an air-gapped (not connected to a network) machine. I spun up a macOS VM without network drivers and set to work. Here comes hurdle number 2; it seems that out of the box VMWare VMs don't like sharing the YubiKey from the Host into the VM.

If you open up the settings of a VM, you will see an item in the USB & Bluetooth tab for the YubiKey but enabling it does nothing.

Luckily it's a pretty easy fix which I'll outline below:

1. Make sure your VM is shut down
2. Navigate to your VM in the Finder
3. Right click on the VM and select Show Package Contents
4. Open the `.vmx` file with a plain-text editor (I like [Atom][6])
5. Add the following two lines at the end of the file and save
  {{< highlight bash >}}
  usb.generic.allowHID = "TRUE"
  usb.generic.allowLastHID = "TRUE"
  {{< / highlight >}}
6. Relaunch your VM
7. With your VM booted, open the Settings, and navigate into the USB & Bluetooth table

8. Click to enable the item that DOES NOT begin with "Shared".
  ![YubiKey Enabled](/images/YubiKey/YubiKey04.png)
9. The Shared will disappear and the YubiKey Personalization Tool within your VM should recognise the YubiKey

I hope this helps. Please let me know if the above method does not work for you.
