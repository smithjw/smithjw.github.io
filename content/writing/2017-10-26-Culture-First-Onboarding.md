<span class="post-meta small">Updated 2018-05-29 to include presentation recording</span>

This morning I had the privilege of presenting at JNUC 2017 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. My talk was an evolution on my previous talks about how I approach Onboarding new hires at Culture Amp.

In the talk I covered the following topics:

- Onboarding new employees
- Standards within your organisation
- Okta
- Jamf Pro
- Apple's Device Enrolment Program (DEP)
- SplashBuddy
