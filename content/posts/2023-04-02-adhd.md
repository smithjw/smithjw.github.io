As you might deduce from the title, I want to briefly discuss some of the common traits associated with ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADHD just over two months ago, and I hope that by the information below, I can help others who may be in a similar situation seek help sooner. This is definitely **not** medical advice but if anything here strikes a chord, please go and chat to your doctor.

Last week I attended the X World conference in Melbourne, where I gave a 5-minute Lightning Talk with Damian Cavanagh. In this post, I'll share the key points we covered, along with some resources that helped me to better understand ADHD and to seek out an official diagnosis.

### ADHD Types

- Inattentive - generally categorised by innatention, distractibility, difficulty focussing
- Hyperactive - generally categorised by impulsive or hyperactive behaviours
- Combined - displays a mix of both (This is me)

### ADHD - Inattentive Traits
*Ask yourself these questions*

- Do you often miss details or makes careless mistakes in work?
- Do you have trouble paying attention to tasks (particularly ones you are not interested in)?
- Do you sometimes miss when someone is speaking directly to you?
- Do you often fail to follow through on instructions or finish tasks/work?
- Do you have trouble organising tasks and activities?
- Do you procrastinate around things that require mental effort over a long period of time?
- Do you lose things regularly (if they aren’t in their home or designated space)?
- Are you often forgetful in daily activities or easily distracted?

### ADHD - Hyperactive Traits
*Ask yourself these questions*

- Do you often fidget (Tapping hands or feet, squirming, bouncing your leg)?
- Do you feel restless in situations you are not interested in?
- Do you sometimes feel unable to relax or unwind?
- Do you sometimes feel like you are “driven by a motor”?
- Do you often talk excessively about subjects that interest you?
- Do you often want to answer a question before it has been completed?
- Do you have trouble waiting your turn (or feeling impatient while waiting for yours)?
