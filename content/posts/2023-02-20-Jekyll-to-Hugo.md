`brew install hugo`

`hugo import smithjw.github.io hugomigration`

Run `add_alias.sh PATH/TO/POSTSDIR`

Will look for all `*.md` files in the given directoy and add an aliases block to each articles frontmatter.

It's very basic and just takes the dates/title from the filename and arranges them into the standard link format for a Hugo site.

If you've customised this, it probably won't work for you
