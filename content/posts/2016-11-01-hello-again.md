Finally moved my site away from Squarespace, a site which I haven't blogged at since 2013 and the most recent activity was probably 2 years ago when I was podcasting on The Verse.

Went with Jekyll hosted on GitHub Pages.

As an aside, I've almost spent $1000 on something I hardly ever use.

## Code Highlighting

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Well isn't this impressive"
```
