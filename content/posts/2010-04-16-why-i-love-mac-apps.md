title: Why I Love Mac Apps
type: post

After switching to the Mac 2 years ago I found out that compared to windows application which are often very functional, they have no style and are not the most pleasing to look at.  I don't know what it is, but Mac developers just seem to make their apps and websites look both amazing and extremely functional.  A couple of really nice posts that highlight this can be found
