What happend this morning when I woke up to read my twitter feed? I saw a nice little note from 
[@UseClear](https://twitter.com/#!/useclear) saying "
Hello New Zealand and Australia :-)". What could this mean? Well, it meant that Clear, the todo app that has had quite a bit of hype surrounding it, had launched.

After using it most of the morning I can say that the 
[video](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/) does not do it justice and you need to download it and try it for yourself. Playing with the app on an iPhone 4S is very quick, I mean REALLY REALLY REALLY quick. Adding tasks is a cinch. Just pull down from the top of the screen and start typing. When you check an item off your list you are rewarded with a chime and subtle vibration, both of which can be changed in the settings. 

I'm not going to say anything further about Clear or all the tips & tricks of using it because it is way too much fun finding them out for yourself and I'm sure someone else will do a nice indepth review later today. All I can say is that you should turn your volume up while playing around with it. You'll thank me later :)

Depending on which country you are in it may or may not be available now. Check it out 
[here](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/clear/id493136154?mt=8)!
