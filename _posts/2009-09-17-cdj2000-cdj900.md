So released a mere 2 hours ago are the new
[CDJ200](http://www.storedj.com.au/products/product.php?id=2735)0 and
[CDJ90](http://www.storedj.com.au/products/product.php?id=2736)0.  They should be released around nov/dec and at a small price of US$2150 for the 2000 and US$1600 for the 900.  I can't wait till they are released and have a play with them.  I better save up some money now.  My only gripe with these two players is that they are only USB1... Why the hell Pioneer would only use USB1 in professional DJing equipment is beyond me but i can't really do anything about that. :(

EDIT:  The Aussie prices have been released with the
[CDJ2000](http://www.storedj.com.au/products/product.php?id=2735) costing $2599 and the
[CDJ900](http://www.storedj.com.au/products/product.php?id=2736) costing $1899.  I might wait i little bit until the price comes down.
